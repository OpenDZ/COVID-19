# Algeria Monitoring workload for COVID-19

Original Repo title is this:
# 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE


***
Update by Djalal Harouni github.com/tixxdz tixxdz@gmail.com

How it works:
-  The original data will be merged from: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
   That is world data sources.

- Algerian data will be merged either from that or manually in directory
  `dz_covid_19_data` that is csv file format.

*For Algerian data source, right now only Confirmed cases is tracked by
state/city as per original data source from the Algerian Ministry of
Health: http://covid19.sante.gov.dz/carte/ there were no reports of the
death cases per city, we may add them at anytime...*


Data is fetched automatically by map.covid19.opendz.org then pushed to
local databases and grafana reads and displays automatically.


There are two databases:

- 'covid19' that is auto updated from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

- 'covid19-dz-production' that is auto updated from sources that are
inside this directory: `dz_covid_19_data`



And finally:
- A cron job is updating the two time series databases.


Inside there is:
nginx+influxdb+grafana+cron job running an app.
